## ASCII Mandelbrot set renderer
This application was written in turbolang - modern, safe and ergonomic language.

## Why should I use turbolang?
Efficiency and performance is number one priority for turbolang. It utilizes LLVM for optimizations and compiles down to native code. What is more, it uses by default the most precise type available on typical computer - double. Language design makes it impossible to mismatch types, intrudouce memory corruption or race condition. Simple syntax makes it easy to learn and use. Both just in time and ahead of time
compilation modes are supported.

## Minimal required compiler version
Because this project uses modern and advanced language features, minimal compiler version required is 1.2.

## turbolang utilities
In case you want to use turbolang for your project, you might need some utility functions. They
are available at (not available yet). Repository contains complex programs as well as useful utility functions. It was made by Adrian Kwiatkowski, who is senior kernel engineer working on kernels in turbolang.
He is reposnsible for developing and maintaning language standard library and spends his free
time on reverse engineering complex applications.
